# OneTap — Agentic Commerce Prototype ⚡

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://onetap11.lovable.app/auth

OneTap is an AI-powered shopping agent that lets users delegate entire purchases using natural language.
Instead of browsing products across multiple websites, users describe an outcome — and the agent handles planning, sourcing, ranking, and checkout orchestration.

This project explores the future of **agentic commerce**, where shopping is driven by intent, not clicks.

## 🚀 What It Does

**The problem**  
Online shopping is fragmented and inefficient. Multi-item purchases require users to compare options across sites, manage delivery constraints, and repeat checkout steps.

**The solution**  
OneTap enables end-to-end shopping delegation:
- Users describe what they want (budget, deadline, preferences)
- The agent breaks intent into concrete needs
- Products are sourced across multiple retailers
- Options are ranked transparently
- Items are combined into a single unified cart with a simulated checkout

This is not a recommendation chatbot — it is a purchasing agent.
